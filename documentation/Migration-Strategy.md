### Migration Strategy for ~9,000+ Repositories from GitLab to GitHub Enterprise Managed Users (EMU)

#### Planning Phase

1. **Assessment and Inventory:**
   - **Identify Repositories:** Create a comprehensive list of all repositories slated for migration.
   - **Evaluate Complexity:** Assess each repository's complexity, considering factors such as size, dependencies, and CI/CD pipelines.
   - **Prioritize Repositories:** Determine the migration order based on the criticality and complexity of each repository.

2. **Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - **Form a Migration Team:** Include representatives from development, operations, security, and project management teams.
   - **Develop a Communication Plan:** Establish a communication strategy to keep all stakeholders informed of migration progress, milestones, and timelines.

3. **Define Migration Goals:**
   - **Set Clear Objectives:** Outline specific objectives for the migration, such as improved CI/CD integration, enhanced security, or streamlined workflows.
   - **Establish Success Criteria:** Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and success criteria to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the migration process.

#### Preparation Phase

1. **Tooling and Automation:**
   - **Select Migration Tools:** Choose tools to automate the migration process, such as `gl_exporter` and custom scripts.
   - **Develop Migration Scripts:** Create scripts to automate various aspects of repository migration, including the migration of issues, pull requests, and CI/CD configurations.

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - **Configure GitHub Enterprise Managed Users (EMU):** Ensure GitHub EMU is properly configured and ready for use.
   - **Set Up Access Management:** Implement SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) and SCIM provisioning for user and access management.
   - **Plan Secrets Management:** Develop a strategy for migrating secrets from GitLab to GitHub Secrets.

3. **Documentation and Training:**
   - **Create Migration Guides:** Develop detailed guides and checklists to standardize the migration process.
   - **Conduct Training Sessions:** Provide training for developers and administrators on using GitHub features and following best practices.

#### Execution Phase

1. **Pilot Migration:**
   - **Select Pilot Repositories:** Identify a small set of repositories for a pilot migration.
   - **Perform Test Migration:** Conduct the migration for the pilot repositories and validate the results.
   - **Collect Feedback:** Gather feedback from the pilot migration and make necessary adjustments before proceeding with a full-scale migration.

2. **Full-Scale Migration:**
   - **Execute Batch Migrations:** Migrate repositories in manageable batches to distribute the workload and reduce risks.
   - **Monitor Progress Continuously:** Regularly track migration progress and address any issues that arise promptly.
   - **Validate Migrated Repositories:** Validate each migrated repository to ensure that all data and configurations have been correctly transferred.

#### Post-Migration Phase

1. **Verification and Testing:**
   - **Conduct Functional Testing:** Test migrated repositories to ensure they are functioning as expected.
   - **Validate CI/CD Pipelines:** Verify that CI/CD pipelines and workflows in GitHub Actions are working correctly.

2. **Optimization:**
   - **Optimize Workflows:** Review and optimize GitHub Actions workflows for improved efficiency and performance.
   - **Implement Security Enhancements:** Apply security best practices, such as using `CODEOWNERS` files and branch protection rules, to enforce compliance and governance.

3. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - **Establish a Feedback Loop:** Create a feedback loop to capture insights from users and continuously refine the migration process.
   - **Update Documentation:** Incorporate lessons learned and best practices into the migration documentation.

#### Things to Avoid

1. **Rushing the Migration:**
   - Avoid rushing through the migration process. Proper planning and methodical execution are crucial for success.

2. **Ignoring Stakeholders:**
   - Engage all stakeholders throughout the migration process to ensure alignment and prevent miscommunication.

3. **Skipping Validation:**
   - Never skip the validation phase. It is essential to thoroughly test and validate each migrated repository to maintain integrity and functionality.

#### Engaging Key Teams

1. **Development Teams:**
   - Engage development teams early in the planning phase to gather requirements and address concerns.
   - Provide training on GitHub features, processes, and best practices to ensure a smooth transition.

2. **Operations and Security Teams:**
   - Work closely with operations and security teams to ensure compliance with security policies and industry best practices.
   - Collaborate on configuring access management and secrets management solutions.

3. **Project Management:**
   - Partner with project managers to coordinate the migration timeline and address any dependencies or blockers.
   - Maintain clear communication and provide regular updates throughout the migration process.

By adhering to these best practices, you can ensure a smooth and successful migration of 9,000+ repositories from GitLab to GitHub Enterprise Managed Users (EMU).
